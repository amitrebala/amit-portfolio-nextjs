## Product

Built a sophisticated AI-powered content moderation platform that revolutionized how premium media brands maintain editorial quality and brand safety at scale. The system combined machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision to automatically assess, categorize, and approve user-generated content across multiple Condé Nast properties.

The platform addressed the critical challenge of maintaining premium editorial standards while processing thousands of daily submissions from a community of 30M+ monthly users, enabling sustainable UGC programs without compromising brand integrity.

## Execution

The AI moderation system development began with comprehensive analysis of existing editorial workflows and content policy requirements across Condé Nast brands. I worked with data science teams to train custom models using historical content data, ensuring alignment with brand-specific editorial standards.

Key technical implementations included real-time content scoring APIs, automated escalation workflows for edge cases, and comprehensive audit trails for editorial oversight. The platform integrated seamlessly with existing CMS systems while providing new administrative tools for content team supervision.

The solution featured sophisticated user feedback mechanisms, allowing community members to report content issues while maintaining automated first-pass filtering. Advanced analytics dashboards provided editorial teams with insights into content trends, policy compliance rates, and community engagement patterns.
